***Compilation Instructions***: To compile, just run `make`. Then to
   run with the provided data file, just type the command `bin/main
   mdata.txt`


***Extra Notes***: 
- user ID's are case sensitive. 'Aaroncot' and
'aaroncot' are two different usernames.  
- keywords that are added are
case sensitive, but when searched they are not. For instance, 'comedy'
and 'COMEDY' would be added as two separate keywords, but when a user
searches for either both film matches would come up. The reason for
this is because I'd allow uniqueness to be determined by the data but
not by a searching user. If the movie data file wants those keywords
to be different so be it--but a user needs to be able to access all
keywords.
